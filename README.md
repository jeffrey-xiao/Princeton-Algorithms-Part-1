###Part 1: Union-Find and Dynamic Connectivity###
        
*Project: Percolation* -- Demonstration of the application of the Weighted Quick Union in order to simulate a "percolation" and to obtain the percolation threshold for a particular N*N grid size.

###Part 2: Stacks, Queues, and Elementary Sorts###
        
*Project: Randomized Queues, and Deques* -- Implementation of a randomized queue, and a deque.

###Part 3: Mergesort and Quicksort###

*Project: Collinear Points* -- Using more sophistacated and tuned sorting algorithms, develop a fast method for finding collinear points. A brute force method was also developed to contrast the runtimes between the efficient method.
