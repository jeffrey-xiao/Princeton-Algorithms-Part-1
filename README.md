## Princeton Algorithms Course: Programming Assignments:

### Part 1: Union-Find and Dynamic Connectivity
        
*Project: Percolation* -- Application of the Weighted Quick Union in order to simulate a "percolation" and to obtain the percolation threshold for a particular N*N grid size.

### Part 2: Stacks, Queues, and Elementary Sorts
        
*Project: Randomized Queues, and Deques* -- Implementation of a randomized queue, and a deque.

### Part 3: Mergesort and Quicksort

*Project: Collinear Points* -- Using more sophistacated and tuned sorting algorithms, develop a fast method for finding collinear points. A brute force method was also developed to contrast the runtimes between the efficient method and the naive solution.

### Part 4: Priority Queues and A* Star Search

*Project: 8-Puzzle* -- Implement an A* search to find a solution to the 8-puzzle.

### Part 5: Binary Search Trees

*Project: Kd tree* -- Using the concept of binary search trees, implement a two dimensional kd tree.
